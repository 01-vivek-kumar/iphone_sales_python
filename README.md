This is my first project, It is simple and utlises the strong understanding of python basics of Data Cleaning, Processing and Visualization.

Why This Project?
Being a fan of Apple products and intrigued by their market strategies, I always wondered what drives their massive sales. Is it the product design? Marketing? Or do certain regions perform better than others? These questions inspired me to explore a dataset about iPhone sales and try to answer them using Python.

### **1. Project Title and Objective**
**Project Title:** *iPhone Sales Analysis*  
**Objective:** The goal of this project is to analyze the sales performance of iPhones to derive actionable insights and support business decisions.

---

### **2. Introduction**
In this project, sales data for iPhones is analyzed to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights. The analysis aims to address questions like:
- What are the top-performing product of iPhone sales?
- How do reviews vary across product model?
- Which time periods exhibit peak sales performance?


### **4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
EDA involves the following steps:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Removing missing values, correcting data types, and ensuring consistency in the dataset.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculating key metrics such as total sales, average revenue, and median units sold.
3. **Data Visualization:** Using plots to highlight trends, such as:
   - Sales.

Key Python libraries used: 
- `Pandas` for data manipulation.
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualizations.
